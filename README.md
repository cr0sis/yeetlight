# yeetlight
A python script to control Yeelight (xiaomi) smartbulbs

This is a very early draft with just 4 options, which I use the most. Development ongoing.

You will need to ensure you have tkinter (should be standard but I found I had to install it) and yeelight installed via:

pip3 install tk

pip3 install yeelight
